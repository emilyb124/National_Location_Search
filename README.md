# National_Location_Search
This program allows the user to search through a database of every location in the United States.
The TestFile.txt included here is a small list of locations, formatted the same way as the entire database,
to see the program run without the giant National File (which can be downloaded at the link below).

When the EveryPlaceHasAName.java file is run with a properly formatted text file in command,
it will prompt the user to enter querries by name (required), state (optional), and county (optional).
All locations in the input file satisfying the querries will be printed to the console, and the user can
can continue asking querries.
